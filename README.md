# graph_theory
Oriented and weighted graph. Vertices are identified by number. At most 1 arc from a given vertex to another given vertex. Load a graph (saved under a text file), read the graph, display the corresponding adjacency matrix, display transitive closure matrix and circuit detection. I implemented this program in Python.
